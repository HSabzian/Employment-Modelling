## WHAT IS IT?

This model is to answer following questions :
1- How do university-quality and industry-advancement affect the employment of university graduates?
1-1- What happens for the employment of university graduates if university-quality and industry-advancement are incoordinated?
1-2- What happens for the employment of university graduates if university-quality and industry-advancement are coordinated?
2- What are the most effective scenarios (parameters combinations ) to secure the highest rate of the employment of university graduates after graduation?


## HOW IT WORKS

According to academic quality, universities are ranked into three grades of grade-1 (white), grade-2(cyan) and grade-3(gray).correspondingly, industries are ranked into three types of type-1 (high-tech with white color), type-2 (mid-tech with cyan color) and type-3 (low-tech with gray color) based on their advancement level.The core mechanism of employment is that the high-tech industries employ graduates of grade-1 universities, the mid-tech industries employ graduates of grade-2 universities and the low-tech industries only employ graduates of grade-3 universities.  


## HOW TO USE IT

"university-quality " is a slider for determining the quality of university system ranging from 0 to 100%.

"industry-advancement" is a slider for determining the modernity and technological level of industries of the country.

"spatial-spread switch " is On when the universities and industries are spatially spread and it is Off when they are concentrated in specific districs.
 
"num-of-industries" is a slider for determining the number of industries.

"unm-of-universities" is a slider for determining the number of universities.

"num-of-targeted-graduates slider" is for determining the number of graduates targeted for a 5-year period by ministry of education or other organizational planners.

"cap-of-hightech-industries" is a slider for determining the capacity level of high-tech industries.

"cap-of-midtech-industries" is a slider for determining the capacity level of mid-tech industries.

"cap-of-lowtech-industries" is a slider for determining the capacity level of low-tech industries.

## THINGS TO NOTICE

"num-of-industries" slider depends on industrial district.

"num-of-universities" slider depends on university district.


## THINGS TO TRY

Use "university-quality slider" and "industry-advancement slider" in the same direction and see unemployemet rate of university graduates.

Use "university-quality slider" and "industry-advancement slider" in the opposite direction and see unemployemet rate of university graduates.

Turn"spatial-spread switch" Off and compare unemployemet rate of university graduates whith when the switch is On.

in which parameter combination, the unemployment rate becomes as minimised as possible?  


## EXTENDING THE MODEL

Add a mechanism in a way that each industry can recruit graduates of each univesrity.

Add a mecahnism for entrepreneurship that when a unemployed graduate becomes 40 year old he or she try entrepreneurial  activities ( with or withouth cooperation of other unempolyed graduates).

Add a mechanism for immigration that when a graduate can not find a good job, he or she immigrates to another country.
